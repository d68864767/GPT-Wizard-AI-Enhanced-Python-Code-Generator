# GPT-Wizard: AI-Enhanced Python Code Generator

## Project Introduction and Purpose

GPT-Wizard is a Python script that leverages the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology to assist developers in generating Python code snippets for common programming tasks. The goal of this project is to empower developers by providing them with an AI-powered tool to streamline the process of generating Python code, ultimately enhancing productivity and code quality.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```
   python gpt_wizard.py
   ```

## Usage Guide with Examples

To use GPT-Wizard, run the script and follow the prompts in the command-line interface. You will be asked to enter a task description, a code category, and any customization options.

Example:
```
Enter the task description: Sort a list of integers
Enter the code category: data_manipulation
Enter any customization options: {"indentation": "spaces", "variable_naming": "camelCase"}
```

## Available Code Categories and Tasks

GPT-Wizard organizes code generation into various categories. The current categories include data manipulation, file handling, and web scraping. Each category contains several tasks. For example, the data manipulation category includes tasks such as sorting, filtering, mapping, and reducing.

## Customization Options

GPT-Wizard allows users to customize the generated code snippets based on their specific requirements and preferences. Current customization options include indentation (spaces or tabs) and variable naming (camelCase or snake_case).

## How GPT-Wizard Works

GPT-Wizard integrates with OpenAI's GPT API to generate initial code snippets based on the provided task description. The code is then customized according to the user's preferences, checked for quality and adherence to PEP 8 guidelines, and documented with comments. The script also includes error-handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected issues during code generation.

## Acknowledgments and Credits

This project uses the OpenAI GPT API for natural language processing and code generation.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this project are welcome. Please submit a pull request with your proposed changes.

## License Information

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more details.

## Testing and Validation

The project includes a test suite to ensure that the generated code snippets are accurate, functional, and well-structured. Run the tests using the following command:
```
python -m unittest test_gpt_wizard.py
```

## Security Measures

GPT-Wizard implements security measures to protect user data and ensure the safe generation of code snippets. These measures include checking the task description for potentially harmful content.

## Error Handling

The script includes error-handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected issues during code generation. If an error occurs, the script will provide a helpful error message and terminate gracefully.

## Documentation and Comments

The generated code snippets include comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code. This helps users understand the code and modify it as needed.

## Continuous Improvement

We plan to continuously improve and update GPT-Wizard to expand the range of supported code tasks and enhance code quality. User feedback is crucial for these improvements.

## User Feedback

We encourage users to provide feedback on the quality and usefulness of the AI-generated code snippets. To provide feedback, please submit an issue on the project's GitHub page.
